		<p>With an international college student population made up of over 400 international undergraduate students representing close to 80 different countries, Tufts celebrates diversity and Global Orientation the perfect place to become a part of the international community on campus!</p>

		<p>Undergraduate Orientation 2015 Approximately 130 first-year and transfer students attend the program, including international students on U.S. visas, U.S. permanent residents, Americans living overseas, as well as a number of students from across the U.S. and U.S. territories. Twenty upper-class students are selected from among American and international students to lead the program as Host Advisors.</p>

		<p>For over thirty years, GO has provided an opportunity for incoming students to meet peers of diverse backgrounds, and to introduce the students to life in the United States, Boston and at Tufts. During GO, the students get to partake in a close intercultural community, and make friends that will remain throughout their time at Tufts.</p>
